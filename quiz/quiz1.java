/* The code defines a class named quiz1.

Inside the class, there is a static method starString that takes an integer parameter n. This method is designed to print a sequence of numbers and is a recursive method.

The base case for the recursion is if (n == 0), in which case the method returns without doing anything.

If n is not zero, it prints the current value of n, calls itself recursively with the argument n - 1, and then prints (n - 1).

The main method is the entry point of the program. It calls the starString method with the argument 3.

Now, let's see what happens when starString(3) is called:

n is 3, so it prints 3.
It then calls starString(2).
n is 2, so it prints 2.
It then calls starString(1).
n is 1, so it prints 1.
It then calls starString(0).
Since n is now 0, it returns without printing anything.
After the recursive call, it prints (n - 1), which is (1 - 1), so it prints 0.
After the recursive call, it prints (n - 1), which is (2 - 1), so it prints 1.
After the second recursive call, it prints (n - 1), which is (3 - 1), so it prints 2.
